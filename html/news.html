                                <h1>AI Can Write Code Like Humans—Bugs and All</h1>
                                <p align="justify">Last June, GitHub, a subsidiary of Microsoft that provides tools for
                                    hosting and collaborating on code, released a beta version of a program that uses AI to
                                    assist programmers. Start typing a command, a database query, or a request to an API,
                                    and the program, called Copilot, will guess your intent and write the rest.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Alex Naka, a data scientist at a biotech firm who signed up to test
                                    Copilot, says the program can be very helpful, and it has changed the way he works. “It
                                    lets me spend less time jumping to the browser to look up API docs or examples on Stack
                                    Overflow,” he says. “It does feel a little like my work has shifted from being a
                                    generator of code to being a discriminator of it.”

                                <h1>Computer Scientists Find Research Algorithm's Limits</h1>
                                <p align="justify">Many aspects of modern applied research rely on a crucial algorithm
                                    called gradient descent. This is a procedure generally used for finding the largest or
                                    smallest values of a particular mathematical function—a process known as optimizing the
                                    function. It can be used to calculate anything from the most profitable way to
                                    manufacture a product to the best way to assign shifts to workers.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Yet despite this widespread usefulness, researchers have never fully
                                    understood which situations the algorithm struggles with most. Now, new work explains
                                    it, establishing that gradient descent, at heart, tackles a fundamentally difficult
                                    computational problem. The new result places limits on the type of performance
                                    researchers can expect from the technique in particular applications.

                                    autocomplete for software development. Much as Gmail tries to finish a sentence as you
                                    write it, Copilot offers to complete a chunk of your program. The tool was released last
                                    summer to a select group of coders.
